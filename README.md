# Linh Pham's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This document outlines a comprehensive index of my projects, detailing the skills utilized, project timelines, and providing placeholders for source code and reports for each. 


*Note 1: As a problem solver, I am continuously developing myself with a steadfast commitment to broadening my skills comprehensively. My philosophy is founded on the belief that ongoing learning and adapting are indispensable for sustained long-term development. I embrace challenges as opportunities and treat feedback as candies to expand my horizons, refine my expertise, and contribute more effectively to my field*

*Note 2: I am on my way to update concretely the documentation of each projects, some missing fields might be filled later (some reports needs permission from teammates that could be public). You can directly visit my source code of all project here: https://github.com/linhlbn*
